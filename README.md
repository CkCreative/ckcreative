### My Story

I have been fascinated by computers since I was in high school - saved up to buy my first Nokia phone in 2011, just so I could be online. I was immediately hooked on the world of programming and software engineering.

I started learning to code by reading books I could find, blogs and later by watching video tutorials. I didn't have access to a computer with the necessary tools, so I practiced by writing code on paper and using a finicky Android setup to run C.

Not long after, I got my first computer; a 10 inch Samsung Mini laptop. I immediately downloaded all the development tools I knew about back then and started building my first projects. You wouldn't believe I squeezed in Adobe's Dreamweaver, Eclipse, among others on such an underpowered machine. By all means, right?

First project? A personal website and a blog. You know what people ask you for when you have a website? That you build them one. I was in business! A website for a local tours and travel agency, one for a national student union, and even a mobile app.

I was passionate and I loved learning new things. I took additional online courses, read more books and articles, and attended meetups and conferences. I was always eager to challenge myself and take on new projects.

A year later, in 2015, I landed my first job with a fancy role of "Digital Business Manager" which essentially meant I was their web developer, sys-admin designer, and social media manager. I haven't told you by this time I knew the basics around Photoshop, Illustrator and Affinity Design, right? In fact, I had already helped startups with their branding materials from logo, company profiles, digital poster and more.

Back to my first job at Toran Tours, I was thrilled to finally be able to use my skills with unlimited autonomy.

Since then, I have worked on a variety of projects, from small websites to large-scale enterprise applications. I have gained experience in a wide range of technologies and languages, including C#, .NET Core, SQL Server, Python, Django, JavaScript, React, Vue.js, Node.js, CSS, HTML, React Native, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, AWS, Linux, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Nginx, Caddy, Client-Server, Microservice, SPA, PWA, Serverless, and Git among others.

I am passionate about software engineering and I love building things. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges. I am confident that I have the skills and experience to deliver exceptional results. Oh, again, I am your ideal teammate!
