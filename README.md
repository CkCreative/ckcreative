### My Story

I have been fascinated by computers since I was in high school. I remember saving up all my money to buy my first Nokia phone in 2011, just so I could be online. I was immediately hooked on the world of programming and software engineering.

I started learning to code by reading books, articles and later by watching online tutorials. I didn't have access to a computer with the necessary tools, so I practiced by writing code on paper and a finicky Android setup to run C programs. I was determined to learn, no matter what.

Eventually, I was able to save up enough money to buy a laptop. I immediately downloaded all the development tools I could find and started building my first projects. I made a blog, a website for a local business, and even a mobile app.

I was passionate and I loved learning new things. I took online courses, read more books and articles, and attended meetups and conferences. I was always eager to challenge myself and take on new projects.

In late 2015, I landed my first job as a web developer. I was thrilled to finally be able to use my skills to build real-world products. I quickly learned the ropes and became a valuable asset to the young company.

Over the past few years, I have worked on a variety of projects, from small websites to large-scale enterprise applications. I have gained experience in a wide range of technologies and languages, including Python, Django, JavaScript, React, Vue.js, Node.js, CSS, HTML, React Native, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, AWS, Linux, GitHub Actions, Docker, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Terraform, Nginx, Caddy, Client-Server, Microservice, SPA, PWA, Serverless, and Git.

I am passionate about software engineering and I love building things. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. I am confident that I have the skills and experience to deliver exceptional results.
